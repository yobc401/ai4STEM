Description: Welcome to ai4materials's README
        ========================================
        
        ai4materials allows to perform complex analysis of materials science data, using machine learning and compressed sensing techniques. It also
        provide functions to pre-process (on parallel processors), save and subsequently load materials science datasets,
        thus easing the traceability, reproducibility, and prototyping of new models.
        
        On the left panel, you can find a few examples that showcase what ai4materials can do.
